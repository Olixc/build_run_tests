# Build and Test Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and runs tests for the project whenever changes are pushed to the repository. The workflow ensures that your code remains functional and passes all tests before merging or deploying.

## Workflow Details

The workflow is triggered by the `push` event on the `main` branch. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the workflow is initiated, executing the defined steps to build and test the project.

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/build-test.yml` file in this repository.

## Workflow Steps

The following steps are executed as part of the workflow:

1. **Checkout code**: This step fetches the latest code from the repository so that subsequent steps can operate on the up-to-date codebase.

2. **Set up Node.js** (Example): This step uses the `actions/setup-node` action to configure the Node.js environment. The version specified (e.g., 14) can be adjusted to match the requirements of your project.

3. **Install dependencies** (Example): This step installs project dependencies using the package manager defined in your project (e.g., npm or yarn). Adjust the command as needed.

4. **Build project** (Example): This step builds the project, typically compiling code or generating required assets. Modify the command based on your specific project's build requirements.

5. **Run tests** (Example): This step executes the test suite of your project to verify the code's functionality and correctness. Update the command based on your project's testing framework and requirements.

Feel free to customize these steps as per your project's requirements, including adjusting the build and test commands, adding additional steps, or configuring specific tools and environments.

## Monitoring the Workflow

You can monitor the progress and output of the workflow by navigating to the "Actions" tab of this repository on GitHub. From there, you'll be able to view the status of each workflow run, check the logs for each step, and identify any issues or failures that may have occurred during the build and test process.

## Contributing

If you encounter any problems with the workflow or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the build and test process and make it more robust.

That's it! Customize the above README file to match your specific project and provide clear instructions and context for other developers working on the project.
